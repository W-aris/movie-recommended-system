# movie-recommended-systemMovie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

📌 Overview

This project implements a Content-Based Filtering approach for movie recommendations. It suggests movies similar to those the user has watched or rated by analyzing movie attributes such as genre, director, actors, etc.

🎯 How It Works

The system processes movie metadata (title, genre, description, etc.).

It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or CountVectorizer to convert text-based movie features into numerical form.

Then, it calculates Cosine Similarity or Euclidean Distance between movies to find the most similar ones.

If a user likes a particular movie (e.g., Inception), the system recommends movies with similar attributes (e.g., Interstellar).

🚀 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)

Scikit-learn (for vectorization & similarity computation)

NLTK (for text preprocessing)

Streamlit (for web-based interaction)

🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/movie-recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

📖 Usage

Enter a movie title.

Click the Recommend button.

The system will display similar movies based on content similarity.

📌 Algorithm Details

Feature Extraction: Converts movie attributes (genre, overview, etc.) into numerical form using:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Weighs word importance.

CountVectorizer: Tokenizes and converts words into a frequency matrix.

Similarity Computation:

Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between two vectors to determine similarity.

Euclidean Distance: Computes the straight-line distance between feature vectors.

📈 Example Recommendation

If you enter "The Dark Knight", the system may recommend:

Batman Begins

Joker

The Prestige

🏗 Future Enhancements

Hybrid Filtering (Combine Content-Based & Collaborative Filtering)

Deep Learning Integration (Autoencoders, Transformers)

Real-time Recommendations with Cloud Deployment
