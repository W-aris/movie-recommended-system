# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

## 📌 **Overview**
This project implements a **Content-Based Filtering** approach for movie recommendations. It suggests movies similar to those the user has watched or rated by analyzing movie attributes such as **genre, director, actors, etc.**

## 🎯 **How It Works**
- The system processes movie metadata (title, genre, description, etc.).
- It uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** or **CountVectorizer** to convert text-based movie features into numerical form.
- Then, it calculates **Cosine Similarity** or **Euclidean Distance** between movies to find the most similar ones.
- If a user likes a particular movie (e.g., *Inception*), the system recommends movies with similar attributes (e.g., *Interstellar*).

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**
- 🐍 **Python**
- 📊 **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** (for vectorization & similarity computation)
- 📝 **NLTK** (for text preprocessing)
- 🌐 **Streamlit** (for web-based interaction)

## 🔧 **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
